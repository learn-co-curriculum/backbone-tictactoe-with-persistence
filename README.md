This is an extension to our last backbone lab.  Here we're going to persist the last games state to our model just like we did in the jquery lab.  However, in this lab rather than saving the state of the game to the DOM (which was a bad solution) let's use the game model.  Add a new attribute to the game model and save the games state there once someone has won or tied.  Add a button to the DOM just like in the jquery example that allows someone to click and have an alert pop up with the text of the last game. The tests won't give you that much guidance as to how to do this, other than verifying that when we click that button we get the right output.  How you implement that functionality is up to you.
